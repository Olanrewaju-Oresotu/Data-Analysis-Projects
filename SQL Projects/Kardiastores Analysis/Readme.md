## Introduction

Kardiastores is a fictional business that deals with customer data, product information, and sales records. This portfolio contains SQL queries and analyses performed on the Kardiastores database to extract meaningful insights and answer important business questions.

## Database Schema

The database consists of three main tables:

- `mastercustomer`: Contains information about customers, including their names, segments, locations, and age.
- `masterproduct`: Contains data related to products, including categories, sub-categories, and product names.
- `storedata`: Stores records of sales transactions, including order details, customer IDs, product IDs, sales amounts, and discounts.

## Queries and Analyses

### Basic Queries

- **Data Import**: The SQL code includes commands to create the database and import data from CSV files into the three tables.
